# jQuery to Modern JavaScript Migration - Interactive Training Platform

Welcome to a fun example of AI-powered interactive training! This demonstrates the approach described in the blog post using a topic every web developer can relate to: migrating from jQuery to modern vanilla JavaScript.

This was born out of my blog post [How I Built Interactive AI-Powered Training with GitHub Copilot ](https://nickperkins.au/article/interactive-ai-copilot-training/) and is designed to show how GitHub Copilot can be transformed into an intelligent tutor for any technical topic.

## What is this?

This is a working example of the AI-powered training platform architecture described in the blog post. It shows how GitHub Copilot can be transformed into an intelligent tutor for any technical topic.

## How to use this example

1. **Open any topic folder** (e.g., `01-understanding-the-dom`)
2. **Type "start the training"** in the chat
3. **Follow along** as GitHub Copilot guides you through interactive lessons
4. **Experiment and ask questions** - the AI adapts to your responses!

## Topics Covered

1. **Understanding the DOM** - Modern ways to select and manipulate elements
2. **Event Handling** - From `.click()` to `addEventListener()`
3. **AJAX to Fetch** - Replacing `$.ajax()` with modern fetch API
4. **Animations** - CSS transitions vs jQuery animations
5. **Final Challenge** - Convert a complete jQuery widget

## Why this example works

- **Relatable**: Most developers have worked with jQuery
- **Progressive**: Each lesson builds on the previous one
- **Hands-on**: Lots of code examples and practice exercises
- **Fun**: Nostalgic jQuery patterns everyone remembers
